    <p>Submitting a Maintenance Request<br>
        When something in your unit needs repair, please submit a maintenance request by emailing propertymaintenance@jeremyleaf.co.uk. Please include the following details:<br>
        - Description of the issue - Explain what is happening, when it began, where it is located etc. Providing as much detail as possible helps our technicians diagnose and prepare for the repair. <br>
        - Photos - If possible, attach photos of the problem that show the damage, malfunction, leak, etc. Pictures are extremely helpful for our team to assess the problem.<br>
        - For appliance issues - note the appliance make and model number if possible. This helps our technician bring the correct parts and tools.<br>
        - Access - Let us know details about accessing the area or unit and if you will be home during the day. This allows efficient entry for repairs.<br>
        - Contact info - Provide your name, and the best way to reach you directly if needed. <br>
        The more details you can provide the better. This allows us to categorize the request properly, dispatch the appropriate technician, and ensure we have everything needed to complete the repair in a single visit. Our goal is to fix all issues quickly and correctly, with minimal disruption to your home.
        Please note the contractors will likely get in touch with you directly to arrange suitable date and time for the visits.</p>
