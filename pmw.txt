- Appliance maintenance - Cleaning and maintaining appliances like refrigerators, washing machines, etc. to prevent breakdowns.

Refrigerators:
- Clean door gaskets every few months to allow sealing. Check for cracks.
- Vacuum dust from vents and coils in the back every 6 months. 
- Defrost freezer if ice builds up over 2-3 mm. Turn off, remove food, empty drip tray.

Ovens:
- Clean spills immediately to avoid baked-on residue. Use oven-safe cleaners.
- Inspect oven door hinges and gaskets regularly. Do not use if severely warped or worn.
- Self-clean ovens according to manual. For regular ovens, use baking soda/vinegar.

Dishwashers:
- Frequently wipe out inside, especially along door to prevent mould. 
- Clean food debris from the filter after each wash.
- Check for leaks underneath. 

Washing Machines: 
- Inspect hoses for cracks. Replace bulging hoses.
- Clean with bleach monthly to disinfect.
- Wipe dry washing machine rim and door to prevent mildew.
-If the washing machine fails to drain water the first step is to check its filter for any blockages.
Here are some steps for cleaning a washing machine's lint filter:
1. Locate the filter. It is usually along the bottom rim of the washing machine tub, behind a small access door. Check your owner's manual if unsure. 
2. Open the access door carefully. Sometimes debris can fall out.
3. Pull out the lint filter. It may be a small mesh screen or perforated plastic.
4. Rinse the filter under running water to wash away lint and residue. You can also use a small brush to dislodge stuck-on debris.
5. If there is a significant lint buildup, fill a sink or bucket with hot water and detergent. Soak the filter for 15-20 minutes to loosen lint.
6. Rinse away detergent thoroughly after soaking and brushing. Trapped detergent can cause excess suds when washing.
7. Dry the filter completely before replacing. Remaining moisture promotes mold growth.
8. Replace the clean lint filter back into its slot and close the access door. Make sure it fits snugly. 
9. Check seal integrity by starting a rinse cycle. If leaks appear, readjust filter.
Be sure to clean the lint filter every few months or whenever you notice decreased water flow. Let us know if the filter becomes damaged or won't fit back into place properly.
Let us know about any appliance issues right away. We'll arrange repair or replacement of damaged appliances. Following proper maintenance procedures can prevent many problems.
