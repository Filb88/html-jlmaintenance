        At Jeremy Leaf & Co., we want to assure our tenants that we are here for you when something needs fixing in your home. Our maintenance team is available around the clock to address any issue - big or small - promptly and correctly. 
        When you report a problem via email, we will dispatch a skilled technician to diagnose and repair the issue. We know that problems don't just happen during business hours, so we are committed to providing emergency assistance if needed. 
        You can trust that our responsive technicians are experienced, licensed, and equipped to handle repairs for plumbing, electrical, HVAC, appliances and more. Throughout the process, we will keep you informed about arrival times, repair status updates, 
        or any next steps needed. Our promise is to make maintenance requests as smooth and convenient as possible for our tenants. By reporting problems early and allowing us to fix them promptly, we can keep your systems and appliances functioning 
        properly and prevent larger issues down the road. If something is broken, damaged, leaking or not working properly in your unit, please let us know right away.
